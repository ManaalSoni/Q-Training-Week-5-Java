Consider the four core interfaces, Set, List, Queue,  and Map. For each of the following four assignments, specify which of the four core interfaces is best-suited,  and explain how to use  it to implement the assignment.

1.Whimsical Toys Inc (WTI) needs to record the names  of all its employees.  Every  month, an employee  will be chosen at random from these  records to receive  a free toy.

Answer:
List
List can be indexed at any position randomly. We simply provide a random number within the length and extract those records.

2.WTI has decided that each new product will be named after an employee  but only first names  will be used,  and each name will be used  only once. Prepare  a list of unique  first names.

Answer:
Set
Set doesn't let there be duplicate entries

3.WTI decides that it only wants to use  the most popular names  for its toys. Count up the number of employees  who have each first name.

Answer:
Map
keys are first names, and each value has frequency of employees with that first name.

4.WTI acquires  season tickets  for the local lacrosse  team, to be shared by employees.  Create  a waiting list for this popular sport

Answer:
Queue
Queue maintains a sequence of entries. Therefore employees coming at the rear end will be the latest and will have their turn last i.e., in sequence.
